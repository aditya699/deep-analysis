# Expectations:

# 1.Our system expects clean data as in data should be well defined in terms of columns and values.
# 2.We have a system that cleans the data but that is early stage and can potentially drop some values.
# 3.After the dashboard generation system we will work on data cleaning system as well(which is the most boring and difficult part since data cleaning is difficult and llm's do not take decisions as we humans do and can be expensive as well since we would have to make multiple api calls to get the data cleaned)
