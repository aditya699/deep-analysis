# ü¶Ü DuckDB Guide for Fast Analytical Dashboards

## üìå Overview

DuckDB is an embedded, in-process SQL OLAP database optimized for analytics. It can run fast SQL queries on large CSV, Parquet, and even Pandas DataFrames directly ‚Äî without needing to load everything in memory. It's perfect for use cases like dashboard engines, ad hoc analytics, and LLM-powered insights.

## ‚úÖ Why Use DuckDB

| Feature                    | Benefit                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **No server**              | Works like SQLite ‚Äî no deployment needed         |
| **Columnar engine**        | Super fast filtering, grouping, and aggregations |
| **Reads CSV/Parquet**      | Directly without full memory load                |
| **SQL support**            | Familiar SQL for complex analysis                |
| **Vectorized**             | Processes rows in batches (C++ speed)            |
| **Integrates with Pandas** | Query DataFrames directly                        |

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install duckdb
```

---

## üìÇ Basic Usage

### Run SQL on CSV

```python
import duckdb

result = duckdb.query("""
    SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM 'sales.csv'
    WHERE region = 'North'
    GROUP BY category
""").df()
```

### Query a Pandas DataFrame

```python
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")
result = duckdb.query("SELECT category, AVG(sales) FROM df GROUP BY category").df()
```

---

## üìä Use Case: KPI API with Filters

### Function

```python
def get_kpi(csv_path, filters: dict):
    where_clause = " AND ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in filters.items()])
    query = f"""
        SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
        FROM '{csv_path}'
        WHERE {where_clause}
        GROUP BY category
    """
    return duckdb.query(query).df()
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integration in Dashboard Engine

1. Upload CSV ‚Üí store in blob storage
2. Download to `/tmp/xyz.csv` for query
3. Pass file path + filters to DuckDB
4. Run query ‚Üí return to frontend as JSON

---

## ‚ö° Tips

* Store CSVs locally before querying
* Use parameterized SQL to avoid injection
* Avoid row-by-row logic (use Pandas if needed)
* Use `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` for preview queries

---

## üìå Summary

DuckDB is the fastest and easiest way to build an analytical engine into your backend. Use it for querying large CSVs, returning filtered KPIs, and generating chart-ready results ‚Äî all with minimal setup.

It's a perfect companion for FastAPI + React dashboards or LLM-powered insights systems.
